# BookAppThakkar

This Java program is an implementation of a book management system. It includes classes to represent books, a bookstore, and drivers to interact with the system. The program allows users to add books, sort them based on different criteria, search for books by title, and display the book collection.

## Description

This program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by creating classes for managing books and a bookstore. The code is properly organized and follows naming conventions. The indentation and readability are well-maintained throughout the program.

### Book Class

The `Book` class represents a book with attributes such as title, author, price, and ISBN. It includes methods to get and set these attributes, as well as methods for comparison and equality.

### BookStore Class

The `BookStore` class manages a collection of books using various sorting algorithms like selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort. It also provides methods for adding books, deleting books by ISBN, and searching for books by title.

### Driver Classes

- `Driver`: This driver class provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the book management system. It allows users to choose different sorting options, search for books, and exit the program.

- `YourDriver`: Similar to the main driver, this class showcases the usage of the `BookStore` class with a different set of books. Users can also choose sorting options, search for books, and exit the program.

The program is designed to compile without errors, and it generates the expected output based on user interactions. The provided description and comments offer a clear understanding of the code's functionality.

## How to Use

1. Compile the Java program using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform operations like sorting, searching, and exiting.
